# <h1 align="center"> Credit risk with machine learning </h1>
#### (under construction)


Data pre-processing for credit risk prediction with Machine Learning algorithm using Python.

### Introduction
This code uses users' credit history to predict whether or not they have paid the requested loans. Data on age, income, status of loans already made are related to make the prediction if the person has paid or not paid the loan, and thus define a standard for making a prediction.
